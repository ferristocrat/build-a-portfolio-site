# Build a Portfolio Site
Udacity Front End Web Development - Project 2: Build a Portfolio Site

## Synopsis

This is the second project for Udacity's **Front End Web Development** course.  I was provided with a design mockup as a PDF-file with the goal of replicating that design in HTML and CSS. This is a responsive website that will display images, descriptions and links to each of the portfolio projects completed throughout the course of the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree.

## Files

* **index.html:** HTML page based on mockup
* **main.css:** Contains all of the CSS needed to style the page.
